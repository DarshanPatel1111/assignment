    15) How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page? With Example.
      
        To add a background image on an HTML element, use the HTML style attribute and the CSS background-image property:

        Ex. <p style="background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');">

       Note : 
       
        If the background image is smaller than the element, the image will repeat itself, horizontally and vertically, until it reaches the end of the element:

        To avoid the background image from repeating itself, set the background-repeat property to no-repeat.

       Ex. 
         
        <style>
               body {
                     background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
                     background-repeat: no-repeat;
                     background-attachment: fixed;
                     background-size: cover;
                     background-size: 100% 100%;
                    }
        </style>
