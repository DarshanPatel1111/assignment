    2) What are tags and attributes in HTML?
       
       While the elements tell the browser what to display, the attributes define how they will behave. The tags mark the beginning and the end of an element. They may not be necessary for some elements, especially the closing tags. Equally important, the attributes are only within the opening tags.
