     12) How to create a Hyperlink in HTML? With Example. 
        
        HTML links are hyperlinks.

        You can click on a link and jump to another document.

        When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

        Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element!
        
        Syntex : <a href="url">link text</a>

        Ex. <a href="https://www.tops-int.com/"> Visit www.tops-int.com </a>

        A) HTML Links - The target Attribute
           
           By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

           The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

           The target attribute can have one of the following values:

           _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
           _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
           _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
           _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window    
          
           Ex.
           
           Use target="_blank" to open the linked document in a new browser window or tab:

           <a href="https://www.tops-int.com/" target="_blank"> Visit www.tops-int.com </a>
