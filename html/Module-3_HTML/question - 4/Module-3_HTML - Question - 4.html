      4)  What are HTML Entities? With Example.
    
        An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand ( & ) and ends with a semicolon ( ; ). Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces).

        Ex. 
        
        <h1>Bio Data</h1>

        <h2>Name : &nbsp; Darshan </h2>
