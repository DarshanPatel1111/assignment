    8) What are the various formatting tags in HTML?

       A) <b> - Bold text 
        
         The HTML <b> element defines bold text, without any extra importance. 
            
         Ex. <b>This text is bold</b>

       B) <strong> - Important text 
          
          The HTML <strong> element defines text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold. 
        
          EX. <strong>This text is important!</strong>
       
       c) <i> - Italic text 
        
          The HTML <i> element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.
          
          Tip : The <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc.

          Ex. <i>This text is italic</i>
       
       D) <em> - Emphasized text

          The HTML <em> element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

          Tip: A screen reader will pronounce the words in <em> with an emphasis, using verbal stress.

        EX. <em>This text is emphasized</em>


       E) <mark> - Marked text
         
          The HTML <mark> element defines text that should be marked or highlighted

          Ex. <p>Do not forget to buy <mark>milk</mark> today.</p>


       F) <small> - Smaller text

          The HTML <small> element defines smaller text

          Ex. <small>This is some smaller text.</small>


       G) <del> - Deleted text
         
          The HTML <del> element defines text that has been deleted from a document. Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text

          Ex. <p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> red.</p>
        

       H) <ins> - Inserted text

          The HTML <ins> element defines a text that has been inserted into a document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text:  

          Ex. <p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> <ins>red</ins>.</p>


       I) <sub> - Subscript text

          The HTML <sub> element defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H2O:

          Ex. <p>This is <sub>subscripted</sub> text.</p>


       J) <sup> - Superscript text
          
          The HTML <sup> element defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a character above the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Superscript text can be used for footnotes, like WWW[1]:

          Ex. <p>This is <sup>superscripted</sup> text.</p>
