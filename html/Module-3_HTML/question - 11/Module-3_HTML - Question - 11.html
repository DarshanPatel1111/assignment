    11) What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element? 
   
        Block elements always start from a new line. Inline elements never start from a new line. Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element

        A) Block-level Elements

           A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

           A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

           Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

           The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

           The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
            
           Syntex : 

              The <p> element is a block-level element.

              The <div> element is a block-level element.

            Ex. 
            
            <p>Hello World</p>

            <div>Hello World</div>    
         
        B) Inline Elements

           An inline element does not start on a new line.

           An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

           This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.    

           Ex.
                  <span>Hello World</span>
