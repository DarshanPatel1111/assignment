    2) What is Domain..?
       
       - A domain, in the context of networking, refers to any group of users, workstations, devices, printers, computers and database 
         servers that share different types of data via network resources. There are also many types of subdomains.
       
       - a set of Internet addresses that end with the same group of letters 
    
       - At its essence, a domain name is what goes in between the protocol sign (HTTP://) and the first slash in a URL or web address.
       
       * The Domain Name System (DNS)
        
         The Domain Name System functions by converting the domain name into an IP address character set, via a Domain Name System server. This system is situated on millions of servers the world over but acts as a single unified database.

         When you type a domain name in your search browser, the browser then communicates with a name server in order to find the IP address that is matched to that name.

         If you have not specified a domain extension, that request will go through a server that sorts by the Domain Name System hierarchy, starting with top-level extensions and then moving on down the line. Unsurprisingly, this made the worldwide web infinitely easier to navigate, which encouraged more people to utilize its services.
